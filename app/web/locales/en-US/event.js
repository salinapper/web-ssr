  'event.explain': 'Significant events are key factors that drive Bitcoinâ€™s price movements. The 2017 bull market was triggered by the geopolitical rivalry over the Korean Peninsula and the subsequent panic in the market. In 2018, North Korea looked for peace talks and the rivalry eased, which, combined with many other events, formed a bear market that lasted one year. Due to more and more institute investors in the field, the USDT crisis, the hack of the alt-coin trading platform Binance and the ever-escalating trade war between China and U.S in the early 2019, capitals are flowing into Bitcoin, which has driven a new price rally.'
